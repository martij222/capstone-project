## Project Idea: All-NBA Team predictions

### What is the problem you want to solve?

My capstone project idea will use regular-season player stats from past NBA seasons to build a machine learning model to predict All-NBA team membership, which is an honor awarded every season in the NBA to the best players in the league.

### Who is your client and why do they care?

My client(s) would be sportsbetters and anyone with a general interest in basketball and/or the NBA.

### What data will your use?

Data used will be from the "Men's Professional Basketball" data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/mens-professional-basketball).
